I need to put something here.

Made this for some friends.
Grabs a list of subs who are currently viewing your stream, to make it easier for giveaway purposes (folks who give 2x entries to subs or other perks).

Need to manually refresh to get up-to-date data and there's a giant refresh button at the top of the screen.

Just keep in mind that it includes yourself too because technically you're a sub to your own stream.
